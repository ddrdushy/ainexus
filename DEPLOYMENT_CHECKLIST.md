3. **Array Type Issues** - Added proper typing for tags array
4. **WebSocket Examples** - Removed examples with missing dependencies

## 🔍 Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Supabase credentials are properly set in `.env`
- ✅ All required environment variables are present
- ⚠️ Make sure your deployment platform has these environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (if needed for server-side operations)

### 2. Database Connection
- ✅ Supabase client is properly configured
- ✅ API routes are using Supabase instead of Prisma
- ⚠️ Make sure your Supabase project has the database schema set up

### 3. Build Process
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint passes
- ✅ Next.js build succeeds
- ⚠️ Some deployment platforms may have specific build requirements

### 4. Dependencies
- ✅ All dependencies are properly installed
- ✅ No conflicting versions
- ⚠️ Sharp package may need additional build tools on some platforms

## 🚀 Deployment Platform Specific Notes

### Vercel (Recommended)
- Environment variables: Add in project settings
- Build command: `npm run build` or `bun run build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Node.js version: 18.x or higher

### Netlify
- Environment variables: Add in site settings
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`
- Node.js version: 18.x or higher

### Railway/Render
- Environment variables: Add in service settings
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Node.js version: 18.x or higher

### Docker
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Install Sharp build dependencies: `apt-get install python3 make g++`

## 🔧 Quick Fix Commands

If deployment still fails, try:

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules .next
bun install

# Test build locally
bun run build

# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
